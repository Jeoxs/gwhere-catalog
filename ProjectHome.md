GWhere allows you to manage a catalogue of your CDs and any other removable media (such as hard disks, floppy disks, Zip disks, CD-ROMs, etc...) indexed in a database. With GWhere it is easy to browse your CDs or to make a quick search without needing to insert each CD one after another.

The original homepage is at http://www.gwhere.org/ but the project there appears to be long dead.
