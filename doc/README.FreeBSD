How to compile GWhere under FreeBSD ?
=====================================
There were problems building included libintl. You had to --disable-nls
or manually set BUILD(USE)_INCLUDED_INTL = no to build with your system
libintl. How should you build it without included intl ?
So it was:
./configure --disable-nls   |  ./configure   disable included intl manually
gmake
gmake install
gmake = GNU make
